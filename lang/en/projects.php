                             Inertia.js, which allowed us to combine Laravel and React

                            share posts, and other registered users could comment and

                             of creating reusable frontend components. I believe I used the 
                             Styled Components package for CSS. I deployed the project through 
                             Vercel, and after several months of work, I found a job overnight

                            consider myself advanced—at most, I’m an advanced beginner. My first
                            project at that company was a one-page presentation site, where
                            I learned to work with Next.js. For CSS, I became familiar with
